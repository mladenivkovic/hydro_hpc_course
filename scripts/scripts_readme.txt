On these scripts and how to use them:


- fortranfile.py
    A python class that enables you to read the fortran output.

- hydro-ffmpeg_makemovie
    creates a movie out of png images. Not intended to be used 
    on its own, is called by the script makemovie.
    If used on its own, it makes a movie out of all .png files 
    in the directory it is called from. 
    It may be given a command line argument for the ouput 
    filename of the movie. If not given, default is 
    ../movie.mp4

- hydro-makemovie_parallel_dry
    makes movie out of all outputfiles in a directory that have 
    been made by a parallel run. 
    It puts the .png output in subdirectory picoutput_parallel.
    The script requires to be run in the same directory as the
    hydro output is and needs a hydro_runinfo.txt file, which
    is generated by the hydro script.
    Usage: hydro-makemovie_parallel_dry

- hydro-makemovie_parallel_samecolorbar
    Same as hydro_makemovie_parallel_dry, but will take two more 
    cmd line args: the lower and upper limit for the colorbar of 
    the plots, so all the .png files will have the same scale.
    Usage:
    makemovie_parallel_samecolorbar <lowerlimit> <upperlimit>    
    If <lowerlimit> is 0.0, it will be set to 1e-4 because the 
    script uses a LogNorm, which can't take 0.0 as an input.

- hydro_makemovie
    A "shortcut" to execute the correct scripts.
    Usage: hydro_makemovie [options]
    Options:
    -h  display help
    -s  create movie for serial execution output
    -p  create movie for parallel execution output
    --l <low> <high> create movie for parallel execution 
    output with same colorbars, where <low> is the lower limit for 
    the colorbar and <high> is the upper limit.
    
- hydro-makemovie_serial 
    makes movie out of all (serial) outputfiles in a directory.
    puts the png output in subdirectory "picoutput".

- hydropic:
    creates a .pdf of a (serial) HYDRO output file.
    use: hydropic.py output_00XXXXXX

- hydropic_movie_parallel_dry
    used by the script hydro-makemovie_parallel_dry to create a 
    .png file from all output files of a parallel run. Can be 
    used on its own:
    hydropic_movie_parallel <outputfiles>
    <ouputfiles> : all outputfiles from all processors for a 
    single snapshot, e.g. output_00038.00001 output_00038.00002
    output_00038.00003 output_00038.00004 (if nproc = 4)
    It puts the .png output in subdirectory picoutput_parallel.
    The script requires to be run in the same directory as the
    hydro output is and needs a hydro_runinfo.txt file, which
    is generated by the hydro script.

- hydropic_movie_parallel_samecolorbar
    Same as hydropic_movie_parallel_dry, but will take two more cmd
    line args: the lower and upper limit for the colorbar of the
    plots, so all the .png files will have the same scale.
    Will be used by makemovie_parallel_barlimits, can be used on
    its own:
    hydropic_movie_parallel_samecolorbar <lowerlimit> 
    <upperlimit> <outputfiles>
    It puts the .png output in subdirectory picoutput_parallel_samecolorbar.
    The script requires to be run in the same directory as the
    hydro output is and needs a hydro_runinfo.txt file, which
    is generated by the hydro script.

- hydropic-movie_serial
    used by hydro-makemovie_serial script to create a movie of 
    all outputfiles in a directory. Not intended to be used on 
    its own, but can be.
    It creates .png pictures out of an output file.
