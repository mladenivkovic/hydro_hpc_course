What has been done so far:


2016-05-08 	Implemented my own module to contain my subroutines
2016-05-09 	The output will now be written to a subdirectory that
			is called "hydro_output"
			Initiated MPI. Makefile changed accordingly.


TO DO:
	- Parallelisation:
		- split domain, set boundaries
		- timestep
		- handle parallel output
