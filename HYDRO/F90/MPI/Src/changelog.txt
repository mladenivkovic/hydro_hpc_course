What has been done so far:


2016-05-08 	
Implemented my own module to contain my subroutines

2016-05-09 	
The output will now be written to a subdirectory that
is called "hydro_output"
Initiated MPI. Makefile changed accordingly.

2016-05-09-10
Worked on domain splitting and boudaries. Didn't work out. Reset.
Time step taken care of.

2016-05-11
Written an MPI dummy routine to communicate boundaries.
Now it works, even though probably not most elegant way
to do things.
Should be able to more or less copy-paste it into the code.

Working on domain splitting and boundaries again.
Going through the whole code replacing loops over i 
with corrected offset of imin and imax.

It finally seems to work. Off to boundaries then!

TO DO:
	- Parallelisation:
		- split domain, set boundaries
		- timestep
		- handle parallel output
